1) How to find the maximum occurring character in a given String? - done
e.g., if the input string is "Java" then the function should return 'a'.

2) How to remove all duplicates from a given string? -done

3) How to print the duplicate characters from the given String?-done

4) How to remove characters from the first String which are present in the second String? -done
 For example, if the first String "India is great" and second String is "in" then the output should be "da s great"

5) How to check if two strings are rotations of each other? 
 e.g. if a given String is "XYZ" and "ZXY" then your function should return true, but if the input is "XYZ" and "YXZ" then return false.

6) How to reverse a given String? -done

7) How to reverse the words in a given String sentence? -done
For example, if the input is "Java is best," then your program should print "best is Java"

8)  How do you check if a given String is Palindrome or not?---> done
For example,"121" is a palindrome, but "123" is not

9) How do you convert String to integer?

10)  How do you remove a given character from String? 
For example, if given String is "Programming" and given character to remove is "m" then your function should return "Prograing".

11)  How do you count a number of words in String?
For example, if input "Java is great" your program should print 3.

--------------------------------------------
1. Find the min and max number of given array?
// input -> int[]a = {700, 100, 10, 6000};

2. Write a program to find if the given program is Armstrong number or not ? (write pseudo code also)

3. Write a java program to print factorial of a number.
Input: 5
Output: 120

4. Prints true if n corresponds to a leap year, and false otherwise.
java LeapYear 2004 => true
java LeapYear 1900 => false
java LeapYear 2000 => true

---------------------------------------------------

1. Write a program to illustrate about inheritance concept in java - Take any simple example
2. Create an ArrayList and insert and retrieve value at a specified index.
3. Replace an element at specified index in Arraylist
4. Search an element of Java ArrayList
5. Reverse an Arraylist.
6. [1,2, 3,3, 56, 676, 34, 99] - sort the list
7. [1,2, 3,3, 56, 676, 34, 99]  Remove the duplicates element

Theoritical
1. Explain the advantage and properties of List
2. What are classes implemented in list interface
3. What are classes implemented in set interface
4. Difference between List & set
5. What is polymorphism
6. How can we prevent method overloading
7. When overloading take place
8. When overriding takes place
9. Write a note on constructor and its access specifier 
10. Write a programe to demonstrate all the access modfier
